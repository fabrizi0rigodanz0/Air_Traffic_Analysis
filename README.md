# Air Traffic Analysis and Distance Calculator

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing air traffic data and calculating distances between various locations. It aims to provide insights into air traffic patterns and offers tools for distance calculations that can be useful for logistics and travel planning.

## Features

- **Air Traffic Data Analysis**: Analyze and visualize air traffic data to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two geographical points using various methods.

## Project Structure

- `docs/`: Contains documentation generated by Sphinx.
- `downloads/`: Contains sample datasets used in the analysis.
- `Functions/`: Source code for data processing and distance calculations.
- `Test/`: Unit tests for the functionality provided in the Functions module.
- `LICENSE`: License under which the project is distributed.
- `Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment configuration file.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-traffic-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd air-traffic-analysis
    ```

3. **Create and activate the Conda environment**:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate air-traffic-env
    ```

4. **Install additional dependencies (if any)**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Air Traffic Analysis**:
    - Navigate to the root directory and open the Jupyter notebook:
        ```sh
        jupyter notebook Notebook.ipynb
        ```
    - Follow the instructions in the notebook to analyze the air traffic data.

2. **Distance Calculator**:
    - Use the distance calculator module by importing it in your script:
        ```python
        from Functions.distance_calculator import calculate_distance
        distance = calculate_distance(coord1, coord2)
        ```
