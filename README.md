# Air Traffic Analysis and Distance Calculator

## Introduction

Our team of elite Data Scientists focuses on analyzing commercial air traffic data within India. Utilizing datasets that encompass airline operations, airplane models, airport locations, and flight routes, this project aims to enhance the understanding and efficiency of India's aviation sector. Through Python tools designed to map airports, analyze flight distances and routes, and compare the usage of different airplane models, we uncover insights into operational patterns, connectivity, and fleet utilization across India's diverse and rapidly growing aviation market.

## Features

- **Air Traffic Data Analysis**: Analyze and visualize air traffic data to uncover trends and patterns specific to India.
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate distances between airports using the Haversine formula.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of airport locations, flight distances, and route distributions.

## Project Structure

- `docs/`: Contains documentation generated by Sphinx.
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets used in the analysis.
- `Functions/`: Source code for data processing and distance calculations.
- `Test/`: Unit tests for the functionality provided in the Functions module.
- `LICENSE`: License under which the project is distributed.
- `Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment configuration file.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-traffic-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd air-traffic-analysis
    ```

3. **Create and activate the Conda environment**:
    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate air-traffic-env
    ```

4. **Install additional dependencies (if any)**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Analyze Airports in India
```python
from Functions.air_traffic_data import AirTrafficData

# Create an instance of AirTrafficData
india_env = AirTrafficData()

# Plot airports by country
india_env.plot_airports_by_country("India")
```
This will generate a map displaying the locations of airports across India.

### 2. Distance Analysis
```python
# Perform distance analysis on routes
india_env.distance_analysis()
```
This will produce a histogram illustrating the distribution of flight distances worldwide.

### 3. Flights from a Specific Airport
```python
# Plot flights departing from Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL)
india_env.flights_from_airport("DEL")
```

### 4. Most Used Airplane Models
```python
# Retrieve the top 3 most used airplane models in India
india_env.most_used_airplane_models(3, country="India")
```

### 5. Aircraft Information
```python
# Get detailed information about a specific aircraft model
india_env.aircraft_info("Canadair Challenger")
```

## Insights and Opportunities

Our analysis reveals several key insights into India's aviation sector:
- **Domestic Travel Optimization**: High frequency of domestic flights suggests opportunities for optimizing flight schedules and aircraft utilization to reduce congestion and fuel consumption.
- **Alternative Transportation**: Developing high-speed rail for routes under 2000 km could alleviate air traffic, reduce carbon emissions, and provide efficient connectivity.
- **Airport Operations**: Implementing energy-saving measures within airports, such as solar power and green buildings, can reduce overall carbon emissions.
- **International Connectivity**: Analyzing passenger and cargo flows for international routes can help optimize these routes for efficiency and reduce duplicate services.
